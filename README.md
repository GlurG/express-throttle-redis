# express-throttle-redis
Redis wrapper for express-throttle

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/express-throttle-redis.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/express-throttle-redis)

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install express-throttle-redis
```

## Usage

```js
var express = require("express");
var throttle = require("express-throttle");
var redis = require("redis");
var RedisStore = require("express-throttle-redis");

var app = express();

app.post("/search", throttle({
	"5/s",
	"store": new RedisStore(redis.createClient())
}), function(req, res, next) {
	// ...
})
```

Keys are automatically expired after *Y x t* ms as defined [here](https://github.com/GlurG/express-throttle#user-content-options). However, as requests are processed new keys will be created and memory usage may grow unbounded. Thus, it is recommended to have a separate redis instance only for throttling purposes with a sensible `maxmemory` setting and `maxmemory-policy` set to `allkeys-lru`. Furthermore, you may want to disable the persistence layer altogether. Consult the [Redis documentation](http://redis.io/documentation) for more information. Also, beware of the [limitations](https://github.com/GlurG/express-throttle/blob/master/README.md) of using this package.

## Performance

Apache Bench was run against [benchmark.js](https://github.com/GlurG/express-throttle-redis/blob/master/test/benchmark.js) and a Redis 3.2 instance with `maxmemory = 8mb` and `maxmemory-policy = allkeys-lru`.

Performance tests for `express-throttle` can be found [here](https://github.com/GlurG/express-throttle/blob/master/Benchmark.md) for comparison.
